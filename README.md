**Title: Express Note Taker

**Github UserName: ClaireBohlen

**Here is the link to my deployed application: I'm having some difficulty with the save and delete button and do not have a delopyed link at the moment. I rearranged some of the express syntax after doing some research and it has seemed to help a bit but the appliction is not 100% functional. I'm working on refractering my code and checking with any errors. I do not get any errors in the command line but when I console log in the browser, I see an error for the main.html file that was already written for us within the starter code. If you're a grader, can you please take a look at the code and provide any reccomendation. Thank you!
